What is a Math Puzzle in CICS?

According to me, a Math Puzzle is a problem that requires good critical thinking. Often treated as riddles, math puzzle are not as easy as they seem as they tend to confuse even the smarter ones. To solve a math puzzle correctly, one must use logical reasoning and critical thinking efficiently. Math, infact, is a medium through which I express my creativity and passion. Ever since I was a small kid, Mathematics has been my favorite subject. While other kids were learning algebra, I had my mind focused on more complicated equations like  e^(iÏ€) +1=0. I was definitely not gifted, but I possessed a passionate curiosity to learn the fundamental concepts of Mathematics. 


A Puzzle I like - Chess

This is a puzzle I came across recently. It's White to play and checkmate in 3 moves. There are 2 solutions to this puzzle but the one I found was the flashier of the 2. 
The solution starts with 

1. Bf6!! 

Which may across as a blunder as the pawn on g7 can simply capture the bishop. However, that was the point all along. 

1. gxf6 
2. Kf8

Kf7 too works but Kf8 leads to the fastest checkmate. 

2. f5 is the only legal move and 
3. Nf7# delivers one the most satisfying checkmates ever.
